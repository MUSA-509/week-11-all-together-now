## CSS Frameworks

* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) — Simple as far as CSS frameworks go but a little dated. More than sufficient for many things we will do in our class. Used in class demos, etc.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) — maybe the most popular CSS framework (and more), but more complicated for starting out
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) — fairly basic but powerful framework that lets you quickly build sites
* [WaterCss](https://watercss.netlify.app/)
* [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/)
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

### Icon libraries
